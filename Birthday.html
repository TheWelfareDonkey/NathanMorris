            <p>Dear Camille,

Don't want to take up to much time from your day because I know you probably have alot planned for your birthday and gonna do everything you probably couldn't last year lol. Let me just jump write in and say Happy Birthday Camille, you're 19 now that's insane loll. There's not much to really say except I'm happy that God help you made it through another year of life and I'm glad you're happy where you're at. I know me and you don't talk at all but always have love for you and will always wish the best for you. I had ordered gifts for you but they're taking a while to come in which might be a good thing cause God knows when next we'll ever see each other. But Ms Camille Zade Brathwaite lol, I wish you nothing but happiness, joy and blessings on your birthday, always remember you're a beautiful and amazing person and we might got our issues but I never stopped seeing that. Cheers to another year and hope you enjoy your birthday!!!

Love,
Nathan :) .</p>
